# Microsoft Security - Microsoft Threat Protection Trial Experience

## What is Microsoft Threat Protection?
Our customers have told us they worry about the growing volume and sophistication of the threat landscape, the expanding attack surface, and the difficulty of making intelligent decisions quickly and cost-effectively.  These customer concerns led to the development of Microsoft Threat Protection (MTP) and the services of this broad solution are designed to work collectively to help solve our customerâ€™s pain points.   Microsoft Threat Protection helps secure the modern workplace across its entire attack surface, securing identities, endpoints, cloud apps, and infrastructure.

## MTP trial experience 
MTP offers the ability to experience the full Microsoft threat protection solution which includes:
- [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/)
- [Azure Advanced Threat Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/azure-advanced-threat-protection/)
- [Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection](https://products.office.com/exchange/online-email-threat-protection)
- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-defender-advanced-threat-protection)
- [Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/cloud-app-security)

Customers who want to try Microsoft Threat Protection can do so for 30 days and up to 250 users on your tenant.
